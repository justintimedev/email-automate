Note that some email services may require you to enable "less secure apps" or generate an "app password" for your account. Be sure to check your email service's documentation for specific requirements.

Before running the code, you may need to install the `smtplib` and `email` libraries if they are not already installed. You can install them using `pip`:

This code will send a simple text email. If you need to send HTML emails or attachments, you can extend the `MIMEMultipart` and `MIMEText` objects to include those components.
