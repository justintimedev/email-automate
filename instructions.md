To automate sending an email with Python, you can use the `smtplib` library to handle the email sending and the `email` library to create and format the email. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to do it:

1. Import the necessary libraries:

```python
import smtplib
from email.mime.text import MIMEText
from email.mime.multipart import MIMEMultipart
```

2. Set up your email credentials and details:

```python
# Email configuration
smtp_server = 'your_smtp_server.com'
smtp_port = 587  # This may vary depending on your email service
sender_email = 'your_email@gmail.com'
sender_password = 'your_password'
receiver_email = 'recipient@example.com'
subject = 'Your Subject'
message = 'Your message content.'
```

3. Create the email content:

```python
# Create a message object
msg = MIMEMultipart()
msg['From'] = sender_email
msg['To'] = receiver_email
msg['Subject'] = subject

# Attach the message text
msg.attach(MIMEText(message, 'plain'))
```

4. Connect to the SMTP server and send the email:

```python
try:
    # Connect to the SMTP server
    server = smtplib.SMTP(smtp_server, smtp_port)
    server.starttls()  # Use TLS encryption

    # Login to your email account
    server.login(sender_email, sender_password)

    # Send the email
    server.sendmail(sender_email, receiver_email, msg.as_string())

    # Close the connection
    server.quit()
    print('Email sent successfully')

except Exception as e:
    print(f'Error: {str(e)}')
```

Make sure to replace the placeholders with your own email and server details. Also, consider using environment variables or a configuration file to store sensitive information like your email password.

Note that some email services may require you to enable "less secure apps" or generate an "app password" for your account. Be sure to check your email service's documentation for specific requirements.

Before running the code, you may need to install the `smtplib` and `email` libraries if they are not already installed. You can install them using `pip`:

```
pip install secure-smtplib
pip install email
```

This code will send a simple text email. If you need to send HTML emails or attachments, you can extend the `MIMEMultipart` and `MIMEText` objects to include those components.
